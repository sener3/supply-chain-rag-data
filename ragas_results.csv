Assess spillover risks from Israel–Lebanon hostilities on Eastern Med ports.,"The spillover risks from Israel–Lebanon hostilities on Eastern Mediterranean ports are significant and multifaceted. The ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran, as well as the potential for conflict escalation, can lead to increased maritime security threats, including blockades and disruptions in shipping routes. For instance, the threat of Houthi forces blocking Israel's Haifa port highlights the vulnerability of key shipping lanes in the region.

Additionally, the geopolitical instability can result in higher freight costs, as seen with Maersk halting calls to Haifa port due to conflict ripples. This disruption not only affects shipping schedules but also has broader implications for trade and supply chains in the Eastern Mediterranean. The potential for cyberattacks, as indicated by reports of Israel's involvement in cyber disruptions at Iranian ports, further complicates the security landscape for maritime operations.

Overall, the spillover risks from hostilities in the region can lead to increased operational costs, delays, and heightened security measures at Eastern Mediterranean ports, impacting global shipping and trade dynamics.","Spillover risks from Israel–Lebanon hostilities pose significant threats to Eastern Mediterranean ports, including potential blockades, port closures, and disruptions in maritime trade. Heightened Iran-Israel tensions have already impacted regional shipping, with threats such as the Houthi blockade of Israel’s Haifa port and the closure of Israel’s Eilat port due to unpaid debts. These conflicts have led to increased freight costs and halted port calls by major shipping companies like Maersk. Additionally, cyberattacks linked to Israel targeting Iranian port facilities exacerbate operational risks. The cumulative effect raises concerns over port blockages, trade disruptions, and broader economic instability in Eastern Mediterranean maritime hubs.","Beirut Port Explosion: Subsequent Investigations and Lawsuits

How do United States–China relations affect semiconductor logistics?,"United States–China relations significantly impact semiconductor logistics due to the ongoing trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Chinese goods. These tariffs have reshaped supply chain planning and global sourcing strategies, prompting companies to develop more resilient and agile supply chains. Logistics professionals emphasize the need for a tiered sourcing hierarchy that prioritizes geopolitical stability, business continuity, and cost efficiency. 

As tariffs increase costs and introduce continuity risks, companies are urged to reassess their supplier relationships and consider alternatives, such as nearshoring or diversifying suppliers beyond China. The urgency to adapt supply chains has intensified, with logistics providers recommending that shippers lock in production schedules and explore alternate routings to manage costs effectively. Overall, the U.S.-China trade conflict has created a complex environment for semiconductor logistics, necessitating strategic planning and flexibility to navigate the evolving landscape.","United States–China relations significantly impact semiconductor logistics by introducing tariffs and trade tensions that disrupt established supply chains. The imposition of high tariffs on Chinese goods has increased costs and created continuity risks, prompting companies to redesign their supply chains with a focus on resilience, agility, and geopolitical stability. Logistics providers advise shippers to adjust sourcing strategies, consider alternative routes, and accelerate production and shipping schedules to mitigate tariff effects. These tensions have accelerated trends like nearshoring and diversified sourcing beyond simple ""China +1"" models, reshaping how semiconductor supply chains are planned and managed globally.","Semiconductor Supply Chain Disruption: Unpacking the US-China Trade Conflict

Duke Law School | Shippers continue to adapt their supply chains amid a sweeping round of tariffs set to take effect next week.
President Trump announced the higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners late Thursday, just ahead of a previously imposed August 1 deadline. Most of the tariffs—which range as high as 41% for some countries—will take effect August 7. Exceptions include the United States’ largest trading partners: Duties on Canadian goods rose from 25% to 35% on Friday; Mexico received a 90-day reprieve on threatened hikes; and China has until August 12 to strike a trade deal.
Analysts and logistics professionals say the industry’s response to the new tariffs will be much the same as it’s been since the administration began its trade war earlier this year: To develop resilient but agile supply chains.
“Tariffs have reshaped how companies approach supply chain planning and global sourcing,” Mike Short, president of global forwarding for logistics services provider
C.H. Robinson
said in an email Friday. “The conversation has evolved beyond a simple ‘China +1’ or ‘+2’ diversification model. What we’re seeing now is a more intentional, tiered sourcing hierarchy that prioritizes geopolitical stability, business continuity, and cost efficiency.
“We’re working closely with customers to reassess their entire supply chain architecture—from sourcing origins to downstream logistics, port selection, and even last-mile delivery. While diversification isn’t a new concept, the urgency and scale at which it’s happening is. Shippers are now laser-focused on building supply chains that are not only resilient but also agile and adaptable. This level of strategic planning is becoming the new standard.”
Gemma Thompson, senior consultant at supply chain and procurement consultancy
Proxima
agreed, adding that the latest round of tariffs increases cost pressures across global supply chains and reinforces the need for companies to build agility into their supply chains.
“While trends like nearshoring and ‘plus +1’ strategies were already in motion, this adds new urgency,” Thompson said in an email. “High tariffs don’t just mean increased costs, they also introduce continuity risks as businesses re-evaluate their supplier relationships. Mexico’s 90-day negotiation window may make it an even more attractive alternative, but companies must understand their full supply chain exposure before making a shift, especially upstream, where rules of origin could still trigger unexpected liabilities.”
Logistics services providers are urging shippers to work with their supply chain partners to stay ahead of pending deadlines.
“Now that tariffs are taking effect, timing is everything. We’re urging shippers to lock in production schedules, push factories to hit cargo‑ready dates, and get goods moving before higher rates cascade through the system,” according to Zeid Houssami, senior vice president and global head of freight forwarding for
Uber Freight
. “On Asia-U.S. trade lanes, we’re also recommending shippers consider alternate routings or consolidations to control costs. Uber Freight is working shoulder‑to‑shoulder with customers to model different tariff scenarios and execute quickly so they can stay ahead of whatever comes next.”
For some, the latest news
adds clarity to the business outlook
, especially coming on the heels of recently announced trade deals.
“In the short term, we’ll see shocks to established supply networks and an inflationary ripple effect across industries,” Thompson added. “The upside is that this announcement provides clarity.

Overall, the declaration highlights the urgent need for disaster relief and long-term strategies to enhance agricultural resilience.","Zambia declares national disaster after drought devastates agriculture

ScienceDirect.com | As climate volatility continues to shape international trade, the top five nations that are most vulnerable to extreme weather and climate sourcing risks are Philippines, Indonesia, India, Colombia, and Mexico, according to a report from Proxima.
The research underscores the urgent need for chief procurement officers (CPOs) to understand—and where necessary, reassess—location decisions and resilience planning, the
German consulting firm Proxima said in its “Global Sourcing Risk Index.”
Additional nations at risk include the US (ranked 7
th
), Australia (ranked 9
th
) and China (ranked 10
th
), largely due to their large geography. But while those major economies have slightly less risk than the top five, disruptions in those countries can have amplified global consequences due to their central role in supply chains, Proxima said.
""Our report underscores the reality that weather and climate events are inextricably linked to the fabric of global trade. For sourcing professionals, this is not a distant risk. It is a present-day challenge that requires urgent, proactive action,” Simon Geale, EVP at Proxima, said in a release.
""Businesses must look beyond traditional risk matrices and factor in both immediate exposure and each market’s true adaptive capacity. Diversifying supply sources across different geographies, holding strategic inventory, and embedding data-led forecasting tools are no longer optional - they are essential for long-term resilience,” Geale said.
To protect against potential climate impact, the report examined three sectors at greater risk than others: food and beverage, construction, and retail. Many of those industries are transitioning to ‘just-in-case’ planning, diversified sourcing, and resilience-first strategies.","Which drought-prone regions present the highest near-term yield risk, and what alternative sourcing options exist?","['Drought risk for agricultural systems in South Africa: Drivers, spatial patterns, and implications for drought risk management\nScienceDirect.com', 'Droughts are creating new supply chain problems.

How are Red Sea security risks reshaping Asia–Europe ocean routing and transit times?,"Red Sea security risks are significantly reshaping Asia–Europe ocean routing and transit times by prompting carriers to avoid the region due to geopolitical violence. As a result, there has been a notable increase in vessel transits around the Cape of Good Hope, which surged by 191% compared to the previous year. This shift in routing is leading to longer transit times and increased risks, as the southern tip of Africa is known for hazardous maritime conditions. Consequently, the changes in routes are causing port congestion and impacting global trade, as ships navigate more challenging waters to maintain commerce while avoiding the Red Sea.","Red Sea security risks are significantly reshaping Asia–Europe ocean routing and transit times by prompting a shift in global trade routes. Due to increased geopolitical tensions and attacks in the region, shipping lines are avoiding the Red Sea and Suez Canal, leading to a 191% increase in vessel transits around the Cape of Good Hope compared to 2023. This rerouting has resulted in longer transit times and heightened risks, as the Cape of Good Hope is known for hazardous maritime conditions. Additionally, the congestion at major ports, such as Singapore, reflects the broader impact of these disruptions on global shipping logistics and inflation.","Singapore Port Congestion Shows Global Ripple Impact of Red Sea Attacks

AInvest | The number of unique services on routes navigating through Houthi-controlled waters has doubled since the third quarter of last year, according to data from eeSea, as carriers who do not call Israel feel growing comfort sailing the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait. | By Alexander Whiteman (The Loadstar) –
Carriers have been warned to proceed with extreme caution following the major widening of the Houthis sphere of attacks announced last week, with lines includ… [+4863 chars] | Ocean container carriers continue to make progress in keeping the boxes on the ships, as the number of containers lost at sea in 2024 was 576 units, up slightly from the record-low 221 containers lost in 2023, but well below the 10-year average of 1,274 containers lost annually.
One reason for the rise in 2024 was ongoing disruption in the Red Sea region, which led to a significant shift in global trade routes,
the World Shipping Council (WSC) said in its annual “Containers Lost at Sea” report.
The change in routes is significant because as ships avoided geopolitical violence near the Suez Canal, vessel transits around the Cape of Good Hope increased by 191% compared to 2023. That contributed to a concentration of losses, since the southern tip of Africa is well-known for hazardous maritime conditions. In fact, the South African Maritime Safety Authority says around 200 containers were lost in this region alone.
“Despite continued loss-prevention efforts by the industry, the re-routing of transits away from the Red Sea and around the Cape of Good Hope to keep global commerce moving has ocean carriers navigating one of the world’s most challenging routes, as highlighted in this report,” Joe Kramek, president & CEO of the WSC, said in a release.
Despite that rise in losses for 2024, the industry continued to improve its safety and prevention measures over the long term, the WSC said. That was seen in improved container handling, stowage, and securing practices performed by everyone from shippers and freight forwarders to terminal operators and ocean carriers.
According to the WSC, safety will continue to improve even more, as several industry initiatives come into effect. They include:
Mandatory reporting of container losses to the IMO will begin in 2026, following adoption of new SOLAS amendments
The Top Tier Joint Industry Project, led by MARIN with WSC participation, will be making its final report to the IMO in September. The project has made major advances in improving container safety, identifying the main reasons for container losses, developing tools to help ocean carriers prevent incidents, as well as recommendations to the IMO for revised regulations and to the ISO for amendments to standards that would significantly enhance container safety.
The WSC Cargo Safety Program, launching in 2025, introduces the first industry-wide system for cargo screening to flag mis/undeclared dangerous goods - a leading cause of shipboard fires.

"How is warehouse vacancy and rent trending in key hubs, and what are the implications for 3PLs?","Warehouse vacancy rates are trending down as leasing activity among third-party logistics providers (3PLs) has increased significantly, with 3PLs signing 38 of the 100 largest leases in the first half of the year, totaling 28.9 million sq. ft. This marks a rise from 28 leases in the same period last year. In contrast, traditional retail and wholesale tenants have seen a decline in their share of leases, indicating a shift in the market dynamics.

As rents rise, large occupiers are opting for smaller industrial lease commitments, leading to a decrease in mega-warehouse leases (1 million sq. ft. and larger) and a reduction in the average size of leases among the largest 100. This trend suggests that companies are becoming more cautious and strategic in their leasing decisions, likely in response to ongoing uncertainties in global trade policies and rising operational costs.

For 3PLs, these trends imply a growing opportunity to capture market share as businesses increasingly outsource their warehousing and supply chain operations. The reliance on flexible 3PL solutions is expected to continue as organizations navigate tariff pressures, geopolitical uncertainties, and other challenges. Overall, while the market is experiencing volatility, the long-term demand for logistics real estate remains strong, driven by factors such as e-commerce growth and the need for operational modernization.","Warehouse vacancy rates are declining, and rental prices are increasing in key hubs, driven by a surge in leasing activity among third-party logistics providers (3PLs).

3PLs dominating warehouse leasing market

. | Third-party logistics providers (3PLs) increased their share of the 100 largest leases in the first half of the year, as large occupiers outsource more of their warehousing and supply chain operations,
according to a CBRE report.
By the numbers, 3PLs signed 38 of the 100 largest leases totaling 28.9 million sq. ft. in this year’s first half. That’s up from 28 leases in the same period last year.
That steep growth pushed general retail and wholesale tenants--which held the largest share of the top 100 leases in H1 2024--down to second place with 28 leases totaling 21.4 million sq. ft. Third place went to e-commerce companies, which signed just seven leases totaling 4.7 million sq. ft., down from the 31 leases totaling 13.2 million sq. ft. in the same period last year. Many e-commerce firms continue to reassess their operations following a period of substantial growth.
""The industrial landscape is evolving,"" John Morris, President of Americas Industrial & Logistics at CBRE, said in a release. “Outsourcing is increasingly prevalent as organizations respond to tariff pressures, geopolitical uncertainty, extreme weather events, and rising labor costs. These factors are complicating supply chain management and driving greater reliance on flexible 3PL solutions.""
CBRE's analysis also revealed that large occupiers are moving toward smaller industrial lease commitments amid higher rents. This is evident in a drop in mega-warehouse leases—those 1 million sq. ft. and larger— accounting for 13 of the top 100 leases, compared to 31 a year earlier. Furthermore, the average size of leases in the largest 100 declined to 718,000 sq. ft. from 814,000 sq. ft. in H1 2024. | Traditional retailers in the US are scaling back their space requirements, according to an annual report, as the volatility over tariffs trickles down to the industrial real estate market. | Cover Story: Leasing market for logistics warehouses remains stable
The Edge Malaysia | In the face of continuing tariff turmoil, the logistics real estate sector saw quarter-over-quarter improvements in net absorption, new leasing activity, and proposals during the second quarter of 2025,
according to a release from warehouse leasing firm Prologis.
That move showed that customers are looking beyond short-term volatility and are continuing to pursue longer-term plans, the firm said in its “Industrial Business Indicator” (IBI) report.
But that volatility is also driving the trends measured in the paper. According to Prologis, utilization averaged 85% in Q2, up 50 basis points compared to the full-year average for 2024. This increase is due in part to customers front-loading inventories in response to changing trade policies. July’s utilization rate, however, dropped to 83.7. Prologis said this decline is related to robust June retail sales, which emptied shelves, and ""choppy"" import patterns, which delayed restocking. The company believes this drop is only temporary.
“We maintain that utilization will be volatile in the near term as shifting trade policies disrupt typical import patterns but generally trend upward as companies grow into any excess capacity,” the report said.
Likewise, the IBI Activity Index reflected slower growth in activity through July as both import flows and retail sales were volatile month to month. Following a surge in pre-buying ahead of tariff implementation, retail sales leveled off and big-ticket purchases slowed, Prologis found.
In conclusion, the study said that while long-term structural drivers of logistics real estate demand remain intact—including the growth of e-commerce and the need to modernize operations—the market is navigating a period of transition shaped by macroeconomic and policy uncertainty. In the face of this volatility, more customers are making deliberate, forward-looking decisions, positioning themselves for long-term success despite near-term ambiguity. | Thailand ready-built warehouses increase by 6.3% in H2 2023

PBS | As climate volatility continues to shape international trade, the top five nations that are most vulnerable to extreme weather and climate sourcing risks are Philippines, Indonesia, India, Colombia, and Mexico, according to a report from Proxima.
The research underscores the urgent need for chief procurement officers (CPOs) to understand—and where necessary, reassess—location decisions and resilience planning, the
German consulting firm Proxima said in its “Global Sourcing Risk Index.”
Additional nations at risk include the US (ranked 7
th
), Australia (ranked 9
th
) and China (ranked 10
th
), largely due to their large geography. But while those major economies have slightly less risk than the top five, disruptions in those countries can have amplified global consequences due to their central role in supply chains, Proxima said.
""Our report underscores the reality that weather and climate events are inextricably linked to the fabric of global trade. For sourcing professionals, this is not a distant risk. It is a present-day challenge that requires urgent, proactive action,” Simon Geale, EVP at Proxima, said in a release.
""Businesses must look beyond traditional risk matrices and factor in both immediate exposure and each market’s true adaptive capacity. Diversifying supply sources across different geographies, holding strategic inventory, and embedding data-led forecasting tools are no longer optional - they are essential for long-term resilience,” Geale said.
To protect against potential climate impact, the report examined three sectors at greater risk than others: food and beverage, construction, and retail. Many of those industries are transitioning to ‘just-in-case’ planning, diversified sourcing, and resilience-first strategies. | Drought Shrivels the Mississippi River and Threatens to Disrupt US Food Exports

Summarize UK Border Target Operating Model changes and their effect on EU–UK agrifood trade.,"The UK Border Target Operating Model changes are part of a broader shift in trade dynamics, particularly affecting EU–UK agrifood trade. As U.K. exporters face increasing tariff volatility, especially with the anticipated rise in U.S. tariffs, many are diversifying their trade routes away from traditional markets like the U.S. to regions such as the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. This shift is driven by the need to adapt to new trade policies and mitigate risks associated with reliance on a single market.

The changes in the operating model may lead to increased operational challenges for U.K. agrifood exporters, particularly smaller retailers who lack formal plans to address sudden trade-policy shocks. As tariffs on U.K. exports rise, the viability of trading with the U.S. diminishes, prompting a reevaluation of export strategies. Consequently, while some sectors may benefit from new opportunities in high-growth regions, the overall impact on EU–UK agrifood trade could be negative, as exporters grapple with higher costs and the need to adjust to a more complex trading environment.","The UK Border Target Operating Model changes are part of a broader shift in trade dynamics, particularly affecting EU–UK agrifood trade. As the UK diversifies its export markets due to increasing tariffs and trade policy uncertainties, it faces challenges in maintaining its agrifood trade with the EU. The introduction of higher tariffs, particularly the anticipated 10% baseline tariff in 2025, is expected to significantly impact the cost structure for UK exporters, making trade with the US less viable and prompting a reevaluation of traditional export strategies. This shift may lead to reduced competitiveness in the EU market, as UK businesses adapt to new trade routes and seek to mitigate risks associated with tariff volatility. Consequently, the agrifood sector may experience disruptions as companies navigate these changes and adjust their operational strategies.","American tariff volatility is shifting long-standing global trade patterns, as 76% of U.K. exporters are now actively diversifying beyond the U.S., which has historically been the U.K.’s largest non-EU retail market,
according to research from ESW and Retail Economics.
In place of the U.S., those British businesses are increasingly looking to trade with partners in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, London-based e-commerce solution provider ESW said.
But not all companies can make the shift. Larger U.K. retailers are radically re-drawing their global growth playbooks as protectionist trade policies upend decades-old export patterns. But 71% of small U.K. retailers admit they have no formal plan for sudden trade-policy shocks, a stark operational gap that could hit their margins overnight.
Those pressures are soon set to spike, as the U.S.’s new baseline 10% tariff in 2025 is set to increase average duties on U.K. non-food exports from 2.3% to 17.2%, forcing retailers to reevaluate long-held assumptions about US viability. In fact, more than half of U.K. exporters would find trade to the US commercially unviable if tariffs exceed 22%, ESW said in its report, “Rethinking Reach: How UK Retailers Are Turning Trade Pressure into Global Advantage.”
“U.K. retailers are undergoing a seismic shift in their export strategies,” Jon Sheard, VP of Northern Europe at ESW, said in a release. “Retailers can no longer be overly reliant on a single trade corridor and are pivoting to new regions, including the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, where we are seeing exponential growth.”
According to the report, exports to the Middle East and North Africa surged 34% between 2021 and 2024, with the UAE now the fastest-growing UK export market outside the EU. Other growth regions include Non-EU Western Europe (+15%) and Asia-Pacific (+6%).
“Tariff volatility is reshaping the global retail landscape,” said Richard Lim, CEO of Retail Economics. “Retailers can no longer rely solely on traditional export markets like the US. Instead, they’re evaluating new trade routes and pivoting toward high-growth regions to diversify risk and capture new demand. Now is the time for exporters to plan and act. Future success will depend on the ability to adapt, localise, and seize emerging trade opportunities.” | How tariffs are shifting global supply chains

Daily Trust | The trade deal between the United States and the European Union,
announced over the weekend
, alleviates some of the recent uncertainty in global markets and is giving businesses a bit of breathing room to adapt to changing trade dynamics.
The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most goods and averts a trade war that might have disrupted economies around the world, according to industry observers.
“While the newly agreed 15% baseline tariff on most EU exports to the U.S. is nearly triple current average rates, it also avoids the far steeper 30% that had been on the table,” Gemma Thompson, a senior consultant at procurement consulting firm Proxima, said in a statement Monday. “It offers a degree of short-term certainty and averts a full-blown trade war, allowing businesses to adapt with greater predictability.”
The higher tariffs were set to take effect August 1.
Thompson said the challenge now is for EU exporters to determine how they will absorb or pass on the additional costs of the tariffs—factors that may lead to further supply chain shifting.
“Where margins are tighter, we’re likely to see knock-on effects to U.S. consumers. Many businesses will also be exploring broader supply chain shifts—for example, routing through lower-tariff countries such as Mexico,” she said. “However, our recent Global Sourcing Risk Index shows that adding Mexico into the supply chain introduces a host of different risks, from political instability to infrastructure and climate-related disruption.”
Outside of the 15% tariffs, both sides agreed to zero tariffs on certain items, such as semiconductor equipment, some agricultural products, natural resources, and other materials. The EU also said it will purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy—to help ease the trading bloc’s reliance on natural gas from Russia—along with further investments in the U.S. economy.
Those moves are a boon to many U.S. businesses but may add complexity to EU companies, according to Thompson.
U.S. exporters “stand to benefit from increased EU investment and zero-tariff access in key categories like energy, aerospace and semiconductors, but they must also prepare operationally to meet the scale of new demand, particularly around energy and defense supply,” Thompson said. “Pharma and spirits remain unresolved, while steel and aluminum tariffs stay at 50%. Regulatory divergence, especially if EU standards are relaxed to align with the U.S., could bring further complexity and reputational risk for European firms.”
Jack Loughney, senior data analyst at global market intelligence company
Interact Analysis
, likewise said the deal eases pressure on the global economy while also producing some clear winners and losers.
“Perhaps the biggest and most important thing is that markets are relieved that an unpredictable trade war appears to have been averted,” Loughney said in a statement Tuesday. “However, putting that aside, and taking into account that full details of the deal have still to be announced, we see a number of winners and losers coming out of this deal.”
At this point, Loughney said winners include the Trump administration—“which has landed a major political win by securing the trade framework with the world’s largest trading bloc, reinforcing his agenda”—along with the U.S. energy sector, U.S. carmakers, and the aviation industry in both regions. U.S. carmakers will benefit from the EU cutting tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles from 10% to 2.5%, potentially boosting exports to Europe, which currently sit at around 15% of total U.S. automotive exports. Aviation will gain because “aircraft, plane parts, and some key components will be tariff-free, benefiting transatlantic aerospace supply chains,” Loughney said.
He said the losers include U.S. consumers, who may face higher prices on EU imports; German carmakers, which face higher costs despite the lower tariffs; EU pharmaceutical companies, which face uncertainty over whether or not the tariffs will apply to EU-made drugs; and “overall European solidarity,” which Loughney said has already been dented because internal divisions have emerged within the EU, with leaders in France, Germany, and Hungary already criticizing elements of the deal.
“Overall, the outlook for the U.S. is still muted according to the Manufacturing Industry Output Tracker—Interact Analysis’s quarterly updated tracker which quantifies the total value of global manufacturing production. However, the new deal should assuage some of the more pressing negative pressure on the global economy,” Loughney said. “On the other hand, the manufacturing sectors of most EU countries and especially Germany (whose problems are much more structural in nature), are already forecast to see their manufacturing sectors shrink in 2025. Any trade deal that puts additional tariffs onto entry into the vital U.S. market can only make things a little worse for them.” | How a potential global tariff war could hit Europe's supply chains

How are fuel price swings influencing bunker surcharges and ocean freight contracts?,"Fuel price swings are significantly influencing bunker surcharges and ocean freight contracts by increasing financial pressures on transport and shipping companies. As rising diesel costs consume a larger portion of their operating budgets—over 20% for more than half of U.S. transport firms—cargo owners are compelled to negotiate for lower ocean shipping rates, often at the expense of their relationships with carriers. This situation is exacerbated by the need for companies to prioritize immediate financial concerns over long-term investments in technology that could help reduce costs in the future. Consequently, if fuel prices continue to rise, it could lead to a strain on logistics companies, limiting their ability to expand and meet growing freight demand, which may further impact ocean freight rates and surcharges across the supply chain.","Fuel price swings, particularly rising diesel costs, are significantly impacting bunker surcharges and ocean freight contracts. As fuel expenses consume a substantial portion of operating budgets—20% or more for 52% of U.S. transport and shipping companies—cargo owners are pressured to negotiate lower shipping rates, often at the expense of carrier relationships. A report indicates that 20% of surveyed transport professionals cite rising diesel prices as their most pressing issue, reflecting a growing concern that has increased over three months. This financial strain limits companies' ability to invest in long-term solutions, such as technology for cost reduction, and may hinder logistics firms from expanding to meet freight demand, potentially leading to higher ocean rates and surcharges across the supply chain.","US tariffs are fuel cost-cutting mandates, heaping pressure on cargo owners to push for lower ocean shipping rates even if at the expense of carrier relations. | Rising diesel costs are eating into freight company budgets, as 52% of U.S. transport and shipping companies now spend 20% or more of their monthly operating budget on fuel costs,
according to a report from Nevada-based technology consulting firm Tech.co.
And some of those companies spend even more. The study found that: 24% of respondents spend 20-29% of their operating budget on fuel; 16% of respondents spend 30-39% of their operating budget on fuel; and 12% of respondents spend 40%+ of their operating budget on fuel.
Of the 264 transport and shipping professionals surveyed in July by Tech.co, 20% said rising diesel prices is the issue currently hitting their businesses the hardest. That was higher than the rates of 16% in June and 13% in May, marking a three-month peak in fuel price concern.
Overall, the researchers found that the biggest problems faced by U.S. transport and shipping firms are:
1. Vehicle upkeep: 20%
2. Managing financial pressures: 17%
3. Adopting new technology: 15%
4. Staffing retention & recruitment: 14%
According to Tech.co’s Content Manager, Aaron Drapkin, that ranking shows that financial pressures have now overtaken concerns around labor shortages.

Assess political risk to supply chains from elections in key sourcing markets this year.,"The political risk to supply chains from elections in key sourcing markets this year is significant, particularly in light of the ongoing geopolitical tensions and the potential for changes in trade policies. The context highlights that major economies like the US and China, while slightly less vulnerable to climate-related disruptions than the top five at-risk nations, can still experience amplified global consequences due to their central roles in supply chains. 

Elections can lead to shifts in leadership that may alter tariffs, trade agreements, and regulatory environments, which can directly impact sourcing decisions and supply chain stability. The report from Proxima emphasizes the need for chief procurement officers to reassess their location decisions and resilience planning in response to these risks. 

Furthermore, the increasing focus on climate volatility and its impact on international trade adds another layer of complexity. Companies are urged to adopt diversified sourcing strategies and resilience-first approaches to mitigate these risks. As political landscapes change, businesses must remain agile and proactive in their supply chain strategies to navigate potential disruptions effectively.","Elections in key sourcing markets this year pose significant political risks to supply chains, particularly in nations vulnerable to climate and geopolitical disruptions.

The urgency for chief procurement officers (CPOs) to reassess location decisions and enhance resilience planning is underscored by the need to factor in immediate exposure to risks and adaptive capacity of markets. Strategies such as diversifying supply sources and implementing data-led forecasting are essential for mitigating these risks.","Tariffs, taxes and trade: The impact of Trump’s reelection on the supply chain
Supply Chain Management Review | As climate volatility continues to shape international trade, the top five nations that are most vulnerable to extreme weather and climate sourcing risks are Philippines, Indonesia, India, Colombia, and Mexico, according to a report from Proxima.
The research underscores the urgent need for chief procurement officers (CPOs) to understand—and where necessary, reassess—location decisions and resilience planning, the
German consulting firm Proxima said in its “Global Sourcing Risk Index.”
Additional nations at risk include the US (ranked 7
th

Assess the effect of drone and missile attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes for container reliability.,"The drone and missile attacks in the Red Sea region have significantly disrupted shipping lanes, leading to a notable shift in global trade routes. As a result, container reliability has been adversely affected. The increase in container losses in 2024, with 576 units lost compared to 221 in 2023, can be attributed to these disruptions. Ships are now rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope to avoid the geopolitical violence near the Suez Canal, which has increased vessel transits by 191%. This alternative route is known for hazardous maritime conditions, contributing to a concentration of losses, particularly with around 200 containers lost in that region alone.

While the shipping industry is implementing improved safety and prevention measures, the ongoing geopolitical tensions and the need for rerouting have made navigating these new routes more challenging. Therefore, the effect of drone and missile attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes has led to decreased container reliability due to increased losses and the complexities of navigating more dangerous waters.","The ongoing drone and missile attacks in the Red Sea region have significantly disrupted shipping lanes, leading to a notable shift in global trade routes. As vessels avoid the geopolitical violence near the Suez Canal, there has been a 191% increase in transits around the Cape of Good Hope compared to 2023. This rerouting has resulted in a concentration of container losses, particularly in hazardous maritime conditions near the southern tip of Africa, where approximately 200 containers were lost. Although the total number of containers lost at sea increased to 576 in 2024, it remains below the 10-year average. The shipping industry is implementing various safety initiatives to improve container reliability, including mandatory reporting of container losses starting in 2026 and the launch of the WSC Cargo Safety Program in 2025. Despite the challenges posed by the Red Sea disruptions, long-term safety measures are expected to enhance container handling and reduce future losses.","The ongoing ripple effects of Red Sea shipping disruptions
Maersk | Ocean container carriers continue to make progress in keeping the boxes on the ships, as the number of containers lost at sea in 2024 was 576 units, up slightly from the record-low 221 containers lost in 2023, but well below the 10-year average of 1,274 containers lost annually.
One reason for the rise in 2024 was ongoing disruption in the Red Sea region, which led to a significant shift in global trade routes,
the World Shipping Council (WSC) said in its annual “Containers Lost at Sea” report.
The change in routes is significant because as ships avoided geopolitical violence near the Suez Canal, vessel transits around the Cape of Good Hope increased by 191% compared to 2023. That contributed to a concentration of losses, since the southern tip of Africa is well-known for hazardous maritime conditions. In fact, the South African Maritime Safety Authority says around 200 containers were lost in this region alone.
“Despite continued loss-prevention efforts by the industry, the re-routing of transits away from the Red Sea and around the Cape of Good Hope to keep global commerce moving has ocean carriers navigating one of the world’s most challenging routes, as highlighted in this report,” Joe Kramek, president & CEO of the WSC, said in a release.
Despite that rise in losses for 2024, the industry continued to improve its safety and prevention measures over the long term, the WSC said. That was seen in improved container handling, stowage, and securing practices performed by everyone from shippers and freight forwarders to terminal operators and ocean carriers.
According to the WSC, safety will continue to improve even more, as several industry initiatives come into effect. They include:
Mandatory reporting of container losses to the IMO will begin in 2026, following adoption of new SOLAS amendments
The Top Tier Joint Industry Project, led by MARIN with WSC participation, will be making its final report to the IMO in September. The project has made major advances in improving container safety, identifying the main reasons for container losses, developing tools to help ocean carriers prevent incidents, as well as recommendations to the IMO for revised regulations and to the ISO for amendments to standards that would significantly enhance container safety.
The WSC Cargo Safety Program, launching in 2025, introduces the first industry-wide system for cargo screening to flag mis/undeclared dangerous goods - a leading cause of shipboard fires.

Assess war-risk implications for Black Sea transit corridors.,"The war-risk implications for Black Sea transit corridors are significant due to the ongoing geopolitical tensions in the region. As highlighted in the context, disruptions in other areas, such as the Red Sea, have already led to shifts in global trade routes, with vessels rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope to avoid conflict. This indicates that similar disruptions in the Black Sea could lead to increased maritime risks, including potential losses of cargo and heightened insurance costs for shipping companies operating in or near the region.

The Black Sea has historically been a strategic maritime corridor, and any escalation in conflict could result in increased piracy, military engagements, or other forms of violence that would deter shipping traffic. Additionally, the potential for toxic contamination from incidents, as noted in the context, raises further concerns about the safety of transit through this area.

Overall, the implications of war risks in the Black Sea could lead to increased shipping costs, longer transit times, and a need for enhanced safety measures and regulations to protect vessels and cargo, similar to the initiatives being implemented in response to challenges in other regions.","The implications of war-risk for Black Sea transit corridors are significant due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and disruptions in global shipping routes. As vessels reroute to avoid conflict in the Red Sea, the Black Sea region may face increased scrutiny and potential risks associated with maritime security. The United Nations Security Council has highlighted the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions, piracy, and cyber threats, which could further complicate transit through the Black Sea. Additionally, the rise in container losses in other regions, such as the Cape of Good Hope, underscores the broader impact of geopolitical instability on maritime operations. As the industry implements new safety measures and regulations, including mandatory reporting of container losses and enhanced cargo safety programs, the overall safety of maritime transit may improve, but the war-risk implications for the Black Sea remain a critical concern for shipping stakeholders.","Ocean container carriers continue to make progress in keeping the boxes on the ships, as the number of containers lost at sea in 2024 was 576 units, up slightly from the record-low 221 containers lost in 2023, but well below the 10-year average of 1,274 containers lost annually.
One reason for the rise in 2024 was ongoing disruption in the Red Sea region, which led to a significant shift in global trade routes,
the World Shipping Council (WSC) said in its annual “Containers Lost at Sea” report.
The change in routes is significant because as ships avoided geopolitical violence near the Suez Canal, vessel transits around the Cape of Good Hope increased by 191% compared to 2023. That contributed to a concentration of losses, since the southern tip of Africa is well-known for hazardous maritime conditions. In fact, the South African Maritime Safety Authority says around 200 containers were lost in this region alone.
“Despite continued loss-prevention efforts by the industry, the re-routing of transits away from the Red Sea and around the Cape of Good Hope to keep global commerce moving has ocean carriers navigating one of the world’s most challenging routes, as highlighted in this report,” Joe Kramek, president & CEO of the WSC, said in a release.
Despite that rise in losses for 2024, the industry continued to improve its safety and prevention measures over the long term, the WSC said. That was seen in improved container handling, stowage, and securing practices performed by everyone from shippers and freight forwarders to terminal operators and ocean carriers.
According to the WSC, safety will continue to improve even more, as several industry initiatives come into effect. They include:
Mandatory reporting of container losses to the IMO will begin in 2026, following adoption of new SOLAS amendments
The Top Tier Joint Industry Project, led by MARIN with WSC participation, will be making its final report to the IMO in September. The project has made major advances in improving container safety, identifying the main reasons for container losses, developing tools to help ocean carriers prevent incidents, as well as recommendations to the IMO for revised regulations and to the ISO for amendments to standards that would significantly enhance container safety.

AInvest | In the face of continuing tariff turmoil, the logistics real estate sector saw quarter-over-quarter improvements in net absorption, new leasing activity, and proposals during the second quarter of 2025,
according to a release from warehouse leasing firm Prologis.
That move showed that customers are looking beyond short-term volatility and are continuing to pursue longer-term plans, the firm said in its “Industrial Business Indicator” (IBI) report.
But that volatility is also driving the trends measured in the paper. According to Prologis, utilization averaged 85% in Q2, up 50 basis points compared to the full-year average for 2024. This increase is due in part to customers front-loading inventories in response to changing trade policies. July’s utilization rate, however, dropped to 83.7. Prologis said this decline is related to robust June retail sales, which emptied shelves, and ""choppy"" import patterns, which delayed restocking. The company believes this drop is only temporary.
“We maintain that utilization will be volatile in the near term as shifting trade policies disrupt typical import patterns but generally trend upward as companies grow into any excess capacity,” the report said.
Likewise, the IBI Activity Index reflected slower growth in activity through July as both import flows and retail sales were volatile month to month. Following a surge in pre-buying ahead of tariff implementation, retail sales leveled off and big-ticket purchases slowed, Prologis found.
In conclusion, the study said that while long-term structural drivers of logistics real estate demand remain intact—including the growth of e-commerce and the need to modernize operations—the market is navigating a period of transition shaped by macroeconomic and policy uncertainty. In the face of this volatility, more customers are making deliberate, forward-looking decisions, positioning themselves for long-term success despite near-term ambiguity. | Bitcoin Whale And Retail Inflows To Binance Fall To Cycle Lows, More Upside Ahead?

Assess risks of tech failures in AI-driven shipping platforms.,"The risks of tech failures in AI-driven shipping platforms can be assessed through several key factors:

1. **Data Security and Privacy**: With transportation and logistics companies handling sensitive data, any failure in AI systems could lead to data breaches, exposing customer information and shipment details. This risk is heightened by the need for compliance with privacy regulations, making robust security protocols essential.

2. **Cost of Implementation**: The significant upfront investment required for AI technologies poses a risk, especially for smaller logistics firms. If the technology fails to deliver the expected return on investment, it could lead to financial strain and operational setbacks.

3. **Integration Challenges**: Many logistics companies still rely on traditional systems that may not be compatible with AI solutions. Failures in integration can disrupt existing workflows, leading to operational inefficiencies and increased reliance on manual processes.

4. **Human Error and Resistance to Change**: Despite AI's potential to reduce human error, the transition to AI-driven systems may still encounter resistance from employees. Inadequate training and a lack of understanding of AI tools can lead to improper use or underutilization of the technology, negating its benefits.

5. **Fragmented Processes**: The complexity of back-office operations, characterized by numerous transactions and partners, increases the risk of errors during the implementation of AI. Failures in standardizing data formats and processes can lead to miscommunication and operational delays.

6. **Dependence on Technology**: Over-reliance on AI systems can create vulnerabilities. If these systems fail or produce inaccurate results, it could lead to significant disruptions in supply chain operations, affecting delivery timelines and customer satisfaction.

7. **Evolving Technology Landscape**: The rapid pace of advancements in AI technology means that companies must continuously adapt. Failing to keep up with emerging technologies could result in obsolescence and a competitive disadvantage.

In summary, while AI has the potential to transform shipping platforms by improving efficiency and reducing errors, the associated risks of tech failures must be carefully managed through strategic planning, robust security measures, and ongoing employee training.","The risks of tech failures in AI-driven shipping platforms primarily stem from several key factors:

1. **Data Security and Privacy**: With the handling of sensitive information, including customer and shipment data, there is a significant risk of data breaches and non-compliance with privacy regulations, which can lead to legal and financial repercussions.

2. **Cost of Implementation**: The high upfront costs associated with AI technologies can be a barrier, particularly for smaller logistics firms. Failure to justify these expenses may result in incomplete or ineffective implementations.

3. **Integration Challenges**: Many logistics companies still rely on traditional systems that are not designed for AI integration. This can lead to operational disruptions and inefficiencies if the AI solutions do not seamlessly connect with existing infrastructure.

4. **Human Error and Resistance to Change**: Despite the potential for AI to reduce errors, the reliance on manual processes and the potential for human resistance to adopting new technologies can hinder successful implementation.

5. **Training and Knowledge Gaps**: Insufficient training on AI tools can lead to underutilization of the technology, resulting in missed opportunities for efficiency gains.

Overall, while AI has the potential to transform back-office operations in shipping, careful planning and execution are essential to mitigate these risks.","When it comes to using AI in shipping, the question isn’t “When?” but “How?” That’s because AI-powered solutions for maritime are already here.

Despite transportation and logistics’ (T&L) critical role in global commerce, the industry has long struggled with inefficiencies, particularly in back-office operations. Manual invoice processing, for instance, remains a major pain point, with discrepancies in freight rates, accessorial charges, and payment terms requiring labor-intensive reconciliation—often delaying settlements by weeks. Similarly, shipment tracking often relies on fragmented systems, forcing employees to cross-reference emails, spreadsheets, and legacy databases to resolve exceptions like delays or damaged goods. Even routine tasks, such as carrier contract compliance checks or customs documentation, are prone to human error, leading to costly penalties and operational bottlenecks.
Given these persistent challenges, could artificial intelligence (AI) be the answer? By automating repetitive tasks—such as invoice validation, exception alerts, and document processing—AI has the potential to streamline workflows, reduce errors, and free up teams to focus on strategic decision-making.
A recent report by research firm Deep Analysis, sponsored by document automation specialist Hyperscience, sheds light on the current state of AI readiness in T&L back-office functions. Titled “Market Momentum Index: AI Readiness in Transportation and Logistics Back-Office Operations,” the report drew on findings from a survey of T&L professionals to reveal both the challenges and opportunities for automation and AI adoption. (For more information about the research and methodology, see sidebar, “About the research.”)
This article summarizes some of the key findings and offers some actionable recommendations for supply chain professionals looking to harness the power of AI to drive efficiency and competitiveness.
THE CRITICAL ROLE OF THE BACK OFFICE
Back-office operations are the administrative core of supply chain processes, encompassing tasks such as order processing, inventory management, billing, compliance documentation, and communications with vendors and carriers. While these tasks are not visible to end consumers, they are vital to maintaining the smooth flow of goods and ensuring on-time deliveries. Furthermore, these operations are typically complex, involving numerous transactions and partners, and, as a result, are often plagued by fragmented processes, duplicated efforts, and misaligned data. Yet, most transportation and logistics companies still depend on manual processes and paper-based systems for their back-office operations, which often lead to errors, delays, and inefficiencies.
For example, the industry relies heavily on documents such as invoices, bills of lading, shipment tracking forms, and compliance records. Many organizations, however, use manual or semi-automated processes to manage these documents. Survey respondents indicated that the manual handling of supply chain documentation is a significant challenge that can have a large impact on overall supply chain efficiency (see Exhibit 1). For instance, missing or incorrect paperwork can cause customs delays, incur fines, or disrupt critical supply chain timelines. Additionally, document handling involves multiple touchpoints, which increases the risk of errors and operational delays. Furthermore, the lack of standardized document formats complicates data sharing and collaboration.
The survey found that many companies have implemented digital tools such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, supply chain management (SCM) systems, transportation management systems (TMS), and warehouse management systems (WMS). These systems were initially marketed as comprehensive solutions capable of automating business processes, improving efficiency, and providing real-time data visibility. However, their effectiveness has been limited by several key challenges. First, high implementation costs and complex integrations often lead to partial deployments, where critical functions remain unautomated. Second, rigid system architectures struggle to adapt to dynamic business needs, forcing employees to rely on manual workarounds—particularly in Excel—to fill functionality gaps. This reliance on spreadsheets introduces high data-entry error rates, inconsistent reporting, and limited data visualization capabilities. Additionally, ineffective user training and resistance to change further hinder adoption, leaving many organizations unable to fully leverage these systems. As a result, despite their potential, ERP, WMS, and similar tools frequently fall short of delivering the promised operational transformation.
THE GROWING INTEREST IN AI
Given the lack of success with other technology tools, there is a perception that supply chain organizations in general—and T&L firms in particular—might be resistant to or uninterested in AI. So it came as a bit of a surprise that the survey results indicated a growing interest in automation and AI within the T&L sector. Over 70% of respondents expressed a willingness to invest in AI-optimized systems, recognizing the potential for these technologies to transform back-office operations.
Of those respondents whose organizations were already using AI, 98% said they view the technology as useful, important, or vital. As Exhibit 2 shows, these respondents are currently employing AI to accomplish a wide range of goals. The report highlights several key areas where AI adds value, such as:
1.
Improved decision-making

How are fuel price hikes reshaping last-mile delivery cost models?,"Fuel price hikes are significantly reshaping last-mile delivery cost models by increasing the financial pressures on transport and shipping companies. As rising diesel costs consume a larger portion of operating budgets—where 52% of companies now allocate 20% or more of their budget to fuel—these companies are forced to prioritize immediate financial concerns over long-term investments. This shift means less funding is available for technology that could optimize routes and reduce fuel consumption, which are essential for managing costs in the long run. Consequently, logistics companies may struggle to expand their operations to meet growing freight demand, as they are already operating at near-full capacity. The ongoing rise in fuel prices is likely to have a cascading effect throughout the supply chain, further complicating last-mile delivery cost models.","Fuel price hikes are significantly impacting last-mile delivery cost models by increasing the financial pressures on transport and shipping companies. According to a report by Tech.co, 52% of U.S. transport and shipping companies now allocate 20% or more of their monthly operating budget to fuel costs, with some spending as much as 40% or more. This rising cost has become the primary concern for 20% of surveyed professionals, surpassing issues like labor shortages. As companies are forced to prioritize immediate financial pressures, they have less capacity to invest in long-term solutions such as technology for route optimization and fuel reduction.
